## About MTrack

MTrack is a personal finance application originally built for personal use and later released publicly.

Core principles:

* **Offline-first** — no cloud, no accounts
* **Local data ownership** — CSV / JSON files on your machine
* **No ads, no tracking, no analytics**
* **Minimal, focused UI**

If you are tired of finance apps that require sign-ups, sync your data, or lock you into ecosystems, MTrack is built for you.
